        "description": "I was part of the team working for a client called Zonal. Zonal is the tech provider for lots of restaurants like Wetherspoon, PizzaExpress, The Restaurant Group, among others. The project is about creating a POS (Point Of Sale) for tablets.\nI was brought as a React Native Senior Developer to lead the team and achieve the release of an MVP in 4 months. My main tasks were to start the react native project in Typescript and to set the architecture. At the same time, Iâ€™ve been involved in architecture meetings about how the xDesign will do React Native projects in the future."
